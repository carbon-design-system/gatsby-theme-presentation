## Agenda

- What is Gatsby?
- Motivation
- Carbon’s Gatsby theme
- In the wild

<Footer />

# What is Gatsby?

<div className="what-is-gatsby">
  “Gatsby is a free and open source framework based on React that helps
  developers build blazing fast websites and apps”
</div>

<Footer />

<Notes>

- Static site generator that uses React (SPA)
- in the same space as Next.js, create-react-app
- js/css performance optimizations and polyfills
- extremely rich plugin ecosystem from detecting broken links to powering client-side search

</Notes>

---

# Motivation

- Carbon’s website started as a standard React project
- rebuilt using Gatsby and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) (Markdown && React)
- other teams at IBM wanted in

<Footer />

<Notes>

## - Difficult for content authors and designers to contribute

## - Big win for empowering non-technical contributors

</Notes>

---

# Other teams wanted in

- forked the Carbon website
- stuck with Gatsby configuration settings
- no design updates, new features, or bug fixes

<Footer />

<Notes>

## So what did that look like?

</Notes>

---

# Enter Gatsby themes

<Footer />

---

# What are Gatsby themes?

- collection of plugins and configuration for Gatsby
- tucked behind a single dependency
- every file can be overriden (shadowed) individually

<Footer />

<Notes>

Last note === Progressive disclosure of complexity, NO BLOCKERS

</Notes>

# gatsby-theme-carbon

- https://gatsby-theme-carbon.now.sh
- Carbon’s open source Gatsby theme (206 ⭐)
- 79 sites on public GitHub
- 130 sites on GitHub enterprise

<Footer />

<Notes>Quickly and easily publish sites that look and feel like Carbon</Notes>

---

# Immediate wins

- development speed
- visual solidarity
- shared features and fixes
- community involvement
- developer portability

<Footer />

<Notes>

1. paint you a picture

- broke ground this time last year
- two teams with no react/Gatsby experience
- both finished their projects under their 2 mos deadline

2. unity through core UI components and shared markdown components
3. Shared features/fixes, mitigate entire class of issues from forking
4. shared tooling = shared work, community components
5. comfortable going between familiar projects

</Notes>

---

# What does the theme give you?

- “Just add markdown”
- Gatsby best practices
- modern Carbon development environment
- preconfigured Carbon shell and layout
- helpful React components for use in markdown (MDX)

<Footer />

<Notes>

# Carbon dev env: quickly speak the IBM design language

# core shell: site wide search

# MDX = markdown that permits react components

</Notes>

---

<Demo
  src="https://gatsby-theme-carbon.now.sh/components/Accordion"
  title="gatsby-theme-carbon MDX components"
/>

<Footer />

<Notes>

- Show components available to content authors in the theme

</Notes>

---

### <div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>What is shadowing? _or..._<br />“Why the theme can't be a blocker”</div>

- allows developers to modify or replace any theme file
- shadowed files go in `src/gatsby-theme-carbon/`
- anything in this folder replaces the theme’s version

<Footer />

<Notes>

# theme reaches for _your_ component first

</Notes>

---

# You can shadow _everything_

- sass – `components/Markdown.module.scss`
- data – `components/Code/prismTheme.js`
- core components - `components/FeedbackDialog.js`
- content components - `components/markdown/blockquote.js`

<Footer />

<Notes>

- core = infrastructure/shell components
- content components are components available to authors in markdown

</Notes>

---

# Shadowing guidelines

1. communication
1. less is more
1. communication

<Footer />

<Notes>

# - to make sure no one is working on your change already

# - Shadow as few files as you can to achieve your goal

# - If you do shadow, tell us. Used to inform future development
