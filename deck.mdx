## Agenda

- What is Gatsby?
- Carbon website story
- Carbon’s Gatsby theme
- wrap up

---

# Background

---

# What is Gatsby?

TODO

---

# Carbon’s website backstory

- started as a standard React project
- rebuilt using Gatsby
- other teams at IBM wanted in

<Notes>

## - Difficult for content authors and designers to contribute

## - Big win for empowering non-technical contributors

## - Only option was to fork Carbon

---

### Pitfalls

## - No way to get new features or fixes.

## - Developers stuck with config they don't own/understand

</Notes>

---

# Other teams wanted in

- forked the Carbon website
- stuck with Gatsby configuration settings
- no design updates, new features, or bug fixes

---

# Enter Gatsby themes

---

# What are themes

- collection of plugins and configuration for Gatsby
- tucked behind a single dependancy
- every file is can be overriden (shadowed) individually

<Notes>

Last note === Progressive disclosure of complexity, NO BLOCKERS

</Notes>

---

# gatsby-theme-carbon

- https://gatsby-theme-carbon.now.sh
- Carbon’s open source gatsby theme
- used by dozens of internal and external projects
- quickly and easily publish sites that look and feel like Carbon

---

# Immediate wins

- development speed
- visual solidarity
- shared features and fixes
- community involvement
- developer portability

<Notes>

1. paint you a picture

- broke ground this time last year
- two teams with no react/gatsby experience
- both finished their projects under their 2 mos deadline

2. unity through core UI components and shared markdown components
3. Shared features/fixes, mitigate entire class of issues from forking
4. shared tooling = shared work, community components
5. comfortable going between familiar projects

</Notes>

---

# What does the theme give you?

- “Just add markdown”
- Gatsby best practices
- modern Carbon development environment
- core ui with Carbon shell and layout components

<Notes>

- Carbon dev env: quickly speak the IBM design language
- site wide search

</Notes>

#### What is shadowing? _or_ “Why the theme can't be a blocker”

<Appear>

Allows developers to augment or replace any theme file
Shadowed files go in a special directory (`src/gatsby-theme-carbon/`).
Anything in this folder replaces the theme’s version.
The theme will reach for _your_ component first.

</Appear>

<Notes>

# Content heavy slide

</Notes>

---

# You can shadow _everything_

- sass – `components/Markdown.module.scss`
- data – `components/Code/prismTheme.js`
- components - `components/FeedbackDialog.js`

<Notes>

## - Hooks are a new react API that allow you to encapsulate logic/behavior

## - shadowing hook to provide 3rd party search

## - reveals Feedback component

</Notes>

---

# Shadowing guidelines

1. communication
1. less is more
1. communication

<Notes>

## - to make sure no one is working on your change already

## - Shadow as few files as you can to achieve your goal

## - If you do shadow, tell us. Used to inform future development
